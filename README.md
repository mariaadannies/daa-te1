# Clustered Binary Sort vs. Randomized Quick Sort Comparison

## Introduction
This repository aims to compare the performance of two popular sorting algorithms: Clustered Binary Sort and Randomized Quick Sort. The comparison focuses on execution time and memory usage to provide insights into the relative strengths and weaknesses of these algorithms in real-world scenarios.

## Usage
To compare the two sorting algorithms, you can use the provided Python scripts:

- clustered_binary_is.py: Contains the Clustered Binary Insertion Sort implementation.
- randomized_quick_sort.py: Contains the Randomized Quick Sort implementation.
- random_dataset.py: This script generates the dataset needed for comparing the two algorithms.
- profiler.py: This script performs the sorting algorithm comparison and measures execution time and memory usage.

## Results
The results of the comparison will be displayed in the console and saved in a report file. You can analyze the execution time and memory usage of Clustered Binary Sort and Randomized Quick Sort for different input sizes.
